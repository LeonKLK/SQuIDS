SQuIDS
===========

Prerequisites
*************

The following packages are required to build and use the library, and
can probably be obtained from your favorite package manager:

* gsl (>= 1.15): http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
* C++ compiler with C++11 support.

Configuration
*************

A configure script, config.sh, is provided in the root directory.

The path for the GSL libraries can be specified running:

./config.sh --with-gsl-incdir=DIR --with-gsl-libdir=DIR

if not specified pkg-config will be used to try to find
the your GSL instalation. After succesful configuration run:

make

To verify that the software is functioning correctly, the 
unit tests can be run with the command:

make test

Finally, the software can be installed using the command:

make install

By default this will attempt to install the library within /usr/local; 
this can be changed by using the --prefix option when running config.sh:

./config --prefix=$HOME

will select to install the softare in the current user's home directory, 
for example. 

Examples
*************

Three examples programs can be found in the examples subdirectory.

In order to plot the example results you will need:

* gnuplot (>4.0): http://www.gnuplot.info/

Documentation
*************

Documentation can be made by running:

make docs

and will be put in the docs subdirectory.
